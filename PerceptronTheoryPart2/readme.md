### Overview
This should provide some basic overview on how to get up and running with the code. If you have any issues, please contact me

The conda environment for this should be the same one used for part 1.

Thanks,<br />
Will Russell<br />


### Setup

- To get up and running you will need to install anaconda
	- [Install Anaconda Instructions ](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)

- Once Anaconda is installed and you have verified that you can run it, instantiate the environment from simple_perceptron.yml
```bash
	conda create --name <your_desired_env_name> --file simple_perceptron.yml
```

- You will then need to activate your environment
```bash
	source activate <your_desired_env_name>
```
- Run the jupyter notebook in the working directory
```python
	jupyter notebook
```

If the browser does not open automatically, just copy the link it gives you.You can fix the issue if desired by modifying jupyter\_notebook\_config but it is not necessary...
