### AI PY  or PY AI...

These are some python implementations of some of the simpler topics in AI which I have put
together from scratch. All of the code implemented in each directory comes with accompanying Jupyter Notebooks to
explore the data and play around with the code in. 

- The Simple Perceptron Theory projects are based on a Rosenblatt Perceptron built using hard and soft(sigmoid) activation
functions.

- Weather Network trains a perceptron model using a linear activation function and very simply demonstrates how one might 
use such a model to predict the weather over a period of time.

- The MiningText project uses a technique of unsupervised clustering to establish the relevancy of sentences to one another
