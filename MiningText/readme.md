## README

### Setup
To get up and running you will need to install anaconda

Once Anaconda is installed and you have verified that you can run it, instantiate the environment from fcan.yml
```python
	conda create --name <your_desired_env_name> --file fcan.yml
```

Run the jupyter notebook as follows
```python
	jupyter notebook FormingClustersAsNeeded.ipynb  # Contains the report
	jupyter notebook FCAN_code.ipynb # Contains the executable version of the code
```

If the browser does not open automagically, just copy the link it gives you.You can fix the issue if desired by modifying jupyter\_notebook\_config but it is not necessary...
