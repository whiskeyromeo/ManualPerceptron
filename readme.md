### Overview
This is still in the early stages, so far I've done some basic plotting but the setup of the decision function still needs to be done.

9.12.2017 --> planning on doing some work this afternoon to clean up the notebook file and actually get things to a more readable state. 

### Setup
To get up and running you will need to install anaconda

Once Anaconda is installed and you have verified that you can run it, instantiate the environment from cmsc409_p1_env.yml
```python
	conda create --name <your_desired_env_name> --file cmsc409_p1_env.yml
```

Run the jupyter notebook as follows
```python
	jupyter notebook Project1.ipynb
```

If the browser does not open automagically, just copy the link it gives you.You can fix the issue if desired by modifying jupyter\_notebook\_config but it is not necessary...
