data.txt

	-Contains all the data that you generated
	-Arranged in 3 columns separated by commas
	-The first column is Height, second column is Weight, third column is gender (0=male, 1=female)


sep_line_a.txt
	- Contains the coefficients of separation lines that you generated for scenario a)
	- Note: these coefficients will be w1 and bias
	- For example, for the separation line: x=T, the corresponding neuron definition will be w1*X-T>=0, where w1=1

sep_line_b.txt
	- Contains the coefficients of separation lines that you generated for scenario b)
	- Note: these coefficients will be w1, w2, and bias
	- For example, for the separation line: y= a*x + b, the corresponding neuron definition will be w1*x + w2*y + bias >=0, where a=-w1/w2; b=-bias/w2.
