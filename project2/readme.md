### Setup

- To get up and running you will need to install anaconda
	- [Install Anaconda Instructions ](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)

- Once Anaconda is installed and you have verified that you can run it, instantiate the environment from cmsc409_p1_env.yml
```bash
	conda create --name <your_desired_env_name> --file cmsc409_p1_env.yml
```

- You will then need to activate your environment
```bash
	source activate <your_desired_env_name>
```
- Run the jupyter notebook as follows
```python
	jupyter notebook Project2.ipynb
```

If the browser does not open automatically, just copy the link it gives you.You can fix the issue if desired by modifying jupyter\_notebook\_config but it is not necessary...
